The GenericPreAmp is a dummy PreAmp model that accounts for
    effects such as decay and rise time, offset, noise and gain.

This dummy model involves no real electronics response, only gain.

This struct is currently mutable because in the case of noise modelling based on data,
    the gain has to match the one in the baselines extracted from data,
    so in that case the PreAmp is initialized with gain = 0, and the gain
    is calculated later. I assume this is temporary, as the user should know which
    gain / max_e the data was produced with and give it as simulation input.

verbosity_level       0   #  0 = terse, 1 = normal, 2 = chatty/verbose

# configuration for mjd_fieldgen (calculates electric fields & weighing potentials)
xtal_grid 			0.1		# grid size in mm for field files (usually 0.5 or 0.1 mm)
impurity_z0      	-0.92	# net impurity concentration at Z=0, in 1e10 e/cm3
impurity_gradient	0.031	# net impurity gradient, in 1e10 e/cm4
impurity_quadratic	0.01	# net impurity difference from linear, at z=L/2, in 1e10 e/cm3

# options for mjd_fieldgen:
max_iterations    30000  # maximum number of iterations to use in mjd_fieldgen
write_field       1      # 0/1: do_not/do write the standard field output file
write_WP          1      # 0/1: do_not/do calculate the weighting potential and write it to the file

# configuration for signal calculation
preamp_tau        0		# integration time constant for preamplifier, in ns
time_steps_calc   40000	# max. number of time steps used in calculations
step_time_calc    0.1	# length of time step used for calculation, in ns
step_time_out     1.0	# length of time step for output signal, in ns

# nonzero values in the next few lines significantly slows down the code
energy             0
charge_cloud_size  0      # initial FWHM of charge cloud, in mm
use_diffusion      0      # set to 0/1 for ignore/add diffusion as the charges drift
use_acceleration   0
use_repulsion      0
